I am currently in my fourth year at UCSB and majoring in Political Science with a minor in Spatial Studies. My coursework  has laid a strong foundation for me to enter the professional workforce. I have recently completed a course that has given me an incredibly strong background in GIS. My studies prepared me for a supportive position within an office or organization as I am incredibly organized and have a history of customer service. I have always been an incredibly organized person and have experience as the secretary of my universityâ€™s sailing team and have organized and managed service projects and trips while still in high school. These experiences taught me how to manage multiple aspects to a project and how to properly plan ahead and think through all parts of a project. 

When I was 13, I began sailing on the SF Bay. I joined [SSS Viking](https://www.facebook.com/SSSViking/), an all female ship that sailed on a historical wooden whaleboat that was built in the 1930s. This program increased my already strong love of nature and especially our environment. In the future, I hope to be able to contribute in some way to fighting against the degradation of our natural resources and our environment through policy or other work. <i class="fas fa-anchor" style="color:red;"></i>
